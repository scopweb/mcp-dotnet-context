# 🛣️ Roadmap - From PoC to Production-Ready Tool

## 📊 Current State (v0.1.0)

**Status:** ⚠️ **Not Production Ready** - Critical issues need fixing

### What Works
- ✅ Basic MCP protocol structure
- ✅ 27+ Blazor Server patterns (from public docs)
- ✅ Pattern storage and retrieval (with security issues)
- ✅ Tree-sitter C# parsing infrastructure

### What's Broken (Critical)
- ❌ **Security:** Path traversal vulnerability in `train-pattern`
- ❌ **MCP Protocol:** Missing Content-Length framing (incompatible with Claude Desktop)
- ❌ **Functionality:** Project analyzer returns empty file list
- ❌ **Tests:** Don't compile due to wrong crate name

---

## 🚨 Phase 0: Critical Fixes (URGENT)

> **These issues must be fixed before any other development.**
> **Estimated time: 1 day**

### 0.1 Security: Path Traversal Vulnerability

**File:** `src/training/mod.rs` (lines 103-108)

**Problem:** `save_patterns()` uses unsanitized `framework` parameter to construct file paths:
```rust
let filename = format!("{}-patterns.json", framework);
let file_path = self.storage_path.join(filename);
```

An attacker can use `train-pattern` with `framework: "..\\..\\..\\Users\\username\\.ssh\\authorized_keys"` to overwrite arbitrary files.

**Fix Required:**
- [ ] Validate framework name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only)
- [ ] Reject path separators (`/`, `\`, `..`)
- [ ] Canonicalize paths and verify they're within storage_path
- [ ] Add unit tests for path traversal attempts

**Severity:** ❗️ CRITICAL (RCE possible on Windows)

---

### 0.2 MCP Protocol: Implement Content-Length Framing

**File:** `src/mcp/mod.rs` (lines 65-76)

**Problem:** Server reads stdin line-by-line expecting raw JSON:
```rust
let mut reader = tokio::io::BufReader::new(stdin).lines();
match reader.next_line().await { ... }
```

MCP protocol requires `Content-Length` header framing:
```
Content-Length: 123\r\n
\r\n
{"jsonrpc":"2.0",...}
```

Claude Desktop and other MCP clients send headers, causing parse errors.

**Fix Required:**
- [ ] Read headers until empty line (`\r\n\r\n`)
- [ ] Parse `Content-Length` header
- [ ] Read exactly N bytes for JSON body
- [ ] Add integration test with proper framing

**Severity:** ❗️ CRITICAL (Server unusable with standard MCP clients)

---

### 0.3 Functionality: Complete ProjectAnalyzer

**File:** `src/analyzer/project.rs` (lines 25-32)

**Problem:** `analyze()` finds .cs files but discards them:
```rust
let _files = self.find_csharp_files(path)?;  // Result ignored!

Ok(DotNetProject {
    files: vec![],  // Always empty
})
```

ContextBuilder receives empty project data, making analysis useless.

**Fix Required:**
- [ ] Use CSharpAnalyzer to parse each .cs file found
- [ ] Populate `files` field with actual file analysis
- [ ] Handle parse errors gracefully (log and continue)
- [ ] Add test verifying files are included

**Severity:** ⚠️ HIGH (Core feature non-functional)

---

### 0.4 Tests: Fix Crate Name in Imports

**File:** `tests/test_analyzer.rs` (line 2)

**Problem:** Tests import wrong crate name:
```rust
use mcp_dotnet_context::analyzer::{...};  // Wrong!
```

Crate is named `mcp-context-rust` in Cargo.toml. `cargo test` fails to compile.

**Fix Required:**
- [ ] Change import to `mcp_context_rust`
- [ ] Verify all test files use correct name
- [ ] Run `cargo test` to confirm tests pass

**Severity:** ⚠️ MEDIUM (CI/CD broken)

## 🎯 Phase 1: Making it Actually Useful

> **Only start after Phase 0 is complete.**

### 1.1 Corporate Knowledge Base Integration

**Problem:** Generic patterns from Microsoft Docs aren't unique value

**Solution:** Connect to YOUR company's knowledge (Confluence/SharePoint/Wiki)

**Impact:** 🚀 HIGH - Claude gets access to knowledge it doesn't have

---

### 1.2 Production Monitoring Integration

**Problem:** No visibility into how code behaves in production

**Solution:** Connect to App Insights/Datadog/Splunk

**Impact:** 🚀 CRITICAL - Claude knows what's actually broken

---

### 1.3 Code Quality Integration

**Problem:** Tree-sitter analysis is basic compared to real tools

**Solution:** Integrate SonarQube/Roslyn analyzers

**Impact:** 🚀 HIGH - Real actionable insights

---

### 1.4 Issue Tracking Integration

**Problem:** No connection to your team's work

**Solution:** Integrate with Jira/Azure DevOps/GitHub Issues

**Impact:** 🚀 HIGH - Claude sees YOUR backlog

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Current State (v0.1.0)
```
Usable: ❌ No (critical bugs)
Security: ❌ Vulnerable
MCP Compatible: ❌ No
Production Ready: ❌ No
```

### After Phase 0 (v0.2.0)
```
Usable: ✅ Yes
Security: ✅ Fixed
MCP Compatible: ✅ Yes
Production Ready: ⚠️ Basic functionality only
```

### After Phase 1 (v1.0.0)
```
Time Saved: ✅ 2-4 hours/week per developer
Unique Value: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (corporate data access)
Production Ready: ✅ Yes
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. ✅ MCP protocol works great (when implemented correctly)
2. ✅ Rust + tree-sitter is solid architecture
3. ❌ Need proper input validation from day one
4. ❌ Must test with real MCP clients during development
5. ❌ Don't skip implementing features (empty files array)
6. ✅ Real value = access to private/corporate data

### Key Insight
> **The MCP isn't useful for what Claude already knows.
> It's useful for what Claude CAN'T know without it.**

**Current Status:** 🔴 Critical fixes needed
**Next Milestone:** v0.2.0 (Phase 0 complete)
**Target Status:** 🚀 Production-Ready
